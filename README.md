# Prim's Algorithm with Priority Queues

This project implements Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees and evaluates its performance using three different data structures for priority queues: Binary Heap, Binomial Heap, and Fibonacci Heap. The implementation generates random graphs and measures the time taken by each data structure to find the minimum spanning tree.
